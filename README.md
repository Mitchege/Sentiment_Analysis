# Introduction
Company Goku is going to launch a new mobile phone soon. They are worried about how people will react to it, and they want to keep an eye on its popularity.

# Problem
The problem at hand is to build an NLP model that can analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products, which have the largest market dominance in the industry. The dataset comprises over 9,000 Tweets that have been rated by human raters as positive, negative, or neutral. This project aims to address the challenge faced by tech companies in understanding customer sentiment towards their products and gain valuable insights from customer feedback. This will improve customer satisfaction and enable Company Goku to stay ahead of the competition in the highly competitive tech industry.
